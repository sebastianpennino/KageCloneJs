This project attempts to recreate the mechanics, controls of the original Kage game for the NES (the game was also known as "Shadow of the ninja" or "Blue shadow" depending on the region).
My objective is to recreate *just the first level of the game* using my knowledge of javascript and my abilities as a graphic designer.
I plan on using [PhaserJS](https://phaser.io/ "Phaser - A fast, fun and free open source HTML5 game framework") and the stuff that I learn for my previous -and unfinished- endeavor "Dr Cruel".
My objetive is also to have a really tight schedule and try to finish it with a final delivery date of three months.

## Organization of folders

`/docs #documentation`

`/tools #source files, links, etc.`

`/game #application`


## Running the game:


1.- Clone the project or download the zipfile

2.- Go to the `/game` folder

3.- Run `npm i` (this will install `live-server`, the only dependency)

4.- Run `npm start` this will open the game on your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8666`


Good luck
