This project attempts to recreate the mechanics, controls of the original Kage game for the NES (the game was also known as "Shadow of the ninja" or "Blue shadow").
My objective is to recreate *just the first level of the game* using my knowledge of javascript and my abilities as a graphic designer.
I plan on using [PhaserJS](https://phaser.io/ "Phaser - A fast, fun and free open source HTML5 game framework") and the stuff that I learn for my previous phaser endeavor "Dr Cruel".
My objetive is also to have a really tight schedule and try to finish it with a final delivery date of three months (only to prove myself that I can do it).
